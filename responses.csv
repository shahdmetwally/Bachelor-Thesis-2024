The Singleton pattern is used when we need to ensure that only one instance of a certain class is ever created. All further references to objects of the singleton class refer to the same underlying instance. 

Here, the Clipboard class is a Singleton. The single instance is created with the 'fgClipboard' static member, which is private. The public method 'getClipboard()' returns this single instance, and there is no other way to get an instance of the Clipboard class because the constructor is private."
